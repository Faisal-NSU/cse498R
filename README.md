<h3> Project Summary</h3>
<p>
This project involves reviewing sentiment classification research and developing a machine learning
model for sentiment analysis of food reviews in Bangla. We collect raw reviews data from FOODPANDA. Text preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning
classification are project methodologies in the sentiment analysis model. We'll use various natural
language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the data, extract necessary features such as word
frequency, TF-IDF, Glove and word to sequence, and then experiment with and compare the results using various machine
learning models.
